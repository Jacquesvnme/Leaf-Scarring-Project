# Current Code

## Basic Info

All images are found in the `images` folder
Most of these images where taken as screenshots from the result of the individual python program
each program is run in a separate, and input is hardcoded into each program
Methods for saving these images still needs to be found

## Description
This is currently how this code works
Images are found below

Begin with `img.jpg` [^1]

use with `foreground.py`
output gained from this is `img_foreground.png`

use `foreground_img.png` at `edge.py`
output gained from this is `img_edge.png`

use `img_edge.png` at `contour_co-ordinates.py`
final output gained is `img_contours.png`
